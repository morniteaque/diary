          "Aurora: This afternoon/evening has been a little rough as far as pain but that's to be expected. It seemed like she had a lot of bleeding/drainage the first few hours and I was concerned but that has slowed substantially so I'm feeling better about that. She's had a good appetite and broke her fast with a soft pretzel and coke because she's very loved and spoiled :) she ate most of her dinner and hasn't vomited which is awesome. She's been pretty uncomfortable which we expected given the surgery and her low pain tolerance but they've been pretty consistent with the meds when asked (given within the hour). She's really groggy and will fall asleep while talking or eating so I've been feeding her and checking her phone for her. We also have an attendant from the clinic with us tonight, M. She's really sweet and is here to help with turning, changing ice packs, calling the nurse, etc. which will be nice; I'm going to try to be good about taking advantage of her presence and actually get some good sleep (haven't had that in a a few days). I appreciate you all!",
